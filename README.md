# Thesis-DSS_2nd
This repository contains all computational resources for the thesis of Max van Hunsel (s2041834). The R files are sequentially numbered to indicate the recommended execution order. Files sharing the same number may be executed in any sequence relative to each other, as their operations are independent within number prefix.

The R files include the data cleaning and calculating the pricing errors of the parametric models

The Jupyter Notebook files include the analysis and the creation of the plots
